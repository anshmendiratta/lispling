# make_lang / `no-ast`

An educational "make-a-LISP" interpreter written in Rust.

## How?

Because of the nature of my learning, no tutorial has been followed or otherwise consulted for this project **as of May 13, 2024**. This helps me keep focus and have fun!

## Git Branches

When beginning this project, the structure of the program and interpreter did not appreciate [Abstract Syntax Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree). Because of this, the project was branched into two versions: one which removed ASTs, and one which retained it.

1. `no-ast`: No ASTs
2. `master`: With ASTs

## Goals

- [ ] Add parsing of numbers
- [ ] Implement evaluation of expressions
    - [ ] For numbers
    - [ ] Variables
- [ ] Store variables
