# make_lang / `inkwell`
A foray into LLVM manifested as a language.

## What?
A small infix programming language. More details as the language is built.

Currently supported syntax:
- 

## How?
Parsing using `nom` and `inkwell`. Using LLVM@18.

## Why?
Language development has always greatly interested me, so it was about time I tried to learn more. This is not meant to be a functional/ready-to-use-for-anyone language. Further, this is only being tested on Linux Mint, so if this does not work for you, good luck.

## Goals
- [ ] Add parsing of numbers
- [ ] Implement evaluation of expressions
    - [ ] For numbers
    - [ ] Variables
- [ ] Store variables
